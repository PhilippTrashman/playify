## ï¼¼(ãƒŽÂºÐ”Âº)ãƒŽ What is Playify?

Playify is a minimalist Discord music bot that gets the job done. No fluff, no fussâ€”just pure music playback with a touch of charm.

- **No web UI.** Just clean, simple commands.
- **No premium tier.** Everythingâ€™s free, always.
- **No limits.** Play giant playlists, queue endless tracks, vibe without restrictions.

**Supports YouTube, YouTube Music, SoundCloud, Spotify, Deezer, Bandcamp, Apple Music, Tidal, and Amazon Music.** Type `/play`, and let the music roll.

## (ï¼¾â–¡ï¼¾) Spotify Support

Playify handles Spotify like a pro:

* âœ… **Individual tracks** â€“ Plays them instantly.
* âœ… **Personal and public playlists** â€“ From small to massive, no problem.
* âœ… **Spotify-curated playlists** (e.g., *This Is*, *Your Mix*, *Release Radar*) â€“ Now fully supported thanks to [SpotifyScraper](https://github.com/AliAkhtari78/SpotifyScraper), which bypasses the official API limitations. ðŸŽ‰

> ðŸ”„ *Note: For dynamic playlists like radios or mixes, the content may differ slightly from what you see in your own Spotify app. These playlists are constantly updated and personalized by Spotify.*

## (â—•â€¿â—•)ãƒŽ Self-Hosting Playify

Want to run Playify yourself? Itâ€™s straightforward.

### Requirements

* **Python 3.9+**: [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **FFmpeg**: For audio processing. Install it:

  * **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg`
  * **macOS**: `brew install ffmpeg`
  * **Windows**: Download from [FFmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add to PATH.
* **Git**: To clone the repo.
* **Discord Bot Token**: Get it from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
* **Spotify API Credentials** (optional, for Spotify support): Create an app on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
* **Genius API Token** (optional, for lyrics): Create a client at [Genius API](https://genius.com/api-clients).

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alan7383/playify.git
   cd playify
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers**:

   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

4. **Copy the example environment file**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. **Edit `.env`** and fill in your tokens:

   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here
   GENIUS_TOKEN=your_genius_api_token_here
   ```

6. **Run the bot**:

   ```bash
   python playify.py
   ```

7. **Invite the bot** to your server:

   * Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
   * Create an application, add a bot, and enable **Guilds** and **Voice States** intents.
   * Generate an invite link with permissions: `Connect`, `Speak`, `Send Messages`.
   * Add the bot to your server and test with `/play`.

### Troubleshooting

* **FFmpeg not found**: Ensure FFmpeg is installed and added to your system PATH.
* **Spotify errors**: Verify your Spotify API credentials and ensure your app is set up correctly.
* **Bot not responding**: Check the Discord token and ensure the bot has proper permissions.

## (ãƒ»Ð”ãƒ»)ãƒŽâ™¥ Privacy First

Your music, your business. Whether you host it yourself or use the hosted Playify bot, **no user data is ever collected or stored**.

* If you're self-hosting: logs stay **local**, only used for debugging â€” no tracking, no analytics, no nonsense.
* If you're using the public Playify bot: only minimal logs (like errors) are kept **temporarily** to help fix bugs. **No playback history, no user tracking, ever.**

If something breaks, I check the logs.
If it works, enjoy the tunes ðŸŽ¶
